<p>I am a hands on Software Development Manager who loves to write code and contribute to the technical aspects of the product's growth. 
    I have spent the past 8 years working for a small software development company (that was acquired by the parent company of Enterprise rent-a-car) 
    to disrupt the urban public transit landscape. 
    I worked as the team lead and then the development manager: writing code, 
    building external relationships, architecting the software, establishing standards, 
    and pushing the product forward while serving the customer's needs.

<h2>A Couple Projects</h2>
<p>I have had a decade long obsession with fully abstracting the developer from the HTTP request response process. 
Two of the frameworks I have written are located on GitHub https://github.com/ev0l/phaux (PHP) 
and https://github.com/ev0l/ESC (Objective-C). 
I am currently doing a similar framework with GO.
</p>

<h2>Synthesizers!</h2>
Synthesizers! FM, Subtractive, Wavetable, OH MY! Playing music, making sounds, and building prototype synthesizers. 
Thats my happy place.
